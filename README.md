# Conformal_Mapping
This repository contains code to perform conformal mapping of a given 3D mesh onto a sphere 
using tuette energy minimization and harmonic energy minimization

The Subdivision directory contains the main code Tuette.cpp which includes code for the conformal map.

Run the makefile and then run the following command:

./Tuette.cpp source_file.obj target_file.obj
